# Credential Enumerator (Unmanaged)

This example program is identical in function the  "[managed](../credenumeratew_managed)" variant, but instead it works directly with the unmanaged
memory, providing a wrapper type to access and free it safely. It's more error-prone and cumbersome to work with,
but serves as an example of working with unmanaged memory and guarding against unsafe access.
